## SINGLE PURPOSE STATEMENT (For "Single Purpose" Field)

This extension serves a single, narrow purpose: managing timed breaks to prevent users from wasting time on websites during break periods.

All features work together to achieve this one goal:

CORE FUNCTION: Break Time Management
When a user wants to take a timed break on any website, they click the extension icon. A timer starts, displays remaining time, sends warnings before expiration, and closes the tab when time is up.

WHY THESE FEATURES ARE PART OF ONE PURPOSE:

Visual Timer Banner - Shows countdown so users know when to return to work
Notifications - Alerts users before break ends to wrap up browsing
Auto Tab Closing - Prevents continued browsing after break time expires
Customizable Duration - Users set their preferred break length (5-60 minutes)
Favorite Sites List - Quick shortcuts to frequently visited break sites
Usage Statistics - Helps users understand their break patterns

All these features serve the single purpose of "preventing excessive break time by providing a visible timer, warnings, and automatic tab closure." The extension does not perform any other function unrelated to break time management.

There is no content blocking, no URL manipulation, no data collection, no external services - only local timer management with user-triggered activation on chosen tabs.
